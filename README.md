# IBM-CLOUD-PROJECT-Travel-Planner-Agent

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and test an AI-powered Travel Planner Agent using IBM Watsonx.ai and LangChain. The agent is capable of providing intelligent travel recommendations and planning assistance by integrating external tools such as Google Search, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, and WebCrawler.

The notebook walks through all steps necessary to design, promote, store, and deploy the agent as an AI Service in IBM Cloud.

üöÄ Features
Deploy a custom AI service to IBM Watsonx.ai.

Integrates with LangChain IBM and Watsonx.ai LLM (Meta-Llama-3-3-70B-Instruct).

Supports tool-based augmentation (GoogleSearch, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, WebCrawler).

Implements both standard response and streaming response APIs.

End-to-end flow from local testing ‚Üí repository storage ‚Üí cloud deployment.

üìÇ Project Structure
Setup Environment

Define credentials for Watsonx.ai.

Connect to IBM Cloud project and deployment space.

Create AI Service Function

Define the Travel Planner agent logic.

Configure chat model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.).

Define utility tools (GoogleSearch, DuckDuckGo, Wikipedia, WebCrawler).

Support both synchronous (generate) and streaming (generate_stream) responses.

Local Testing

Run the AI service function locally with sample messages.

Store & Deploy Service

Store the agent in the Watsonx.ai repository.

Define request and response schemas.

Deploy service with metadata (name, description, tags).

Test AI Service

Run the deployed service via the deployment ID.

Validate cloud execution with test prompts.

üì° API Example
Once deployed, you can call the Travel Planner Agent as a REST API.

Sample Payload:

json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Plan a 5-day trip to Paris with top attractions."
    }
  ]
}
Sample Response:

json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Here‚Äôs a detailed 5-day travel itinerary for Paris..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
üìå Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to:
‚úÖ Create a custom AI service using IBM Watsonx.ai & LangChain.
‚úÖ Enhance agent intelligence with external tools (search, crawling, knowledge sources).
‚úÖ Seamlessly deploy AI agents as scalable services in IBM Cloud.
‚úÖ Test both local and cloud-deployed functions with real-time responses.

The Travel Planner Agent is a blueprint for building more industry-specific agents (finance advisor, healthcare assistant, shopping bot, etc.). By extending tools and customizing schemas, you can deploy production-level AI services quickly.
